                    The insurance industry is one of the largest industries in the
                    United States, with over $1.5 trillion in annual premiums. The word
                    "insurance" comes from the French word "assurer", which means "to
                    make sure". The first insurance company in the United States was
                    founded in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1735. The insurance
                    industry employs over 2 million people in the United States. The
                    average American household spends about $1,500 per year on insurance
                    premiums. The most expensive type of insurance in the United States
                    is long-term care insurance, which can cost upwards of $5,000 per
                    month.
